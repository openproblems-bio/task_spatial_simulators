  summary: "Assessing the quality of spatial transcriptomics simulators"
  description: "Computational methods for spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT)\
    \ are frequently developed \nand assessed through data simulation. The effectiveness\
    \ of these evaluations relies on the \nsimulation methods' ability to accurately\
    \ reflect experimental data. However, a systematic \nevaluation framework for\
    \ spatial simulators is lacking. Here, we present SpatialSimBench, \na comprehensive\
    \ evaluation framework that assesses 13 simulation methods using 10 distinct \n\
    STR datasets.\n\nThe research goal of this benchmark is to systematically evaluate\
    \ and compare the\nperformance of various simulation methods for spatial transcriptomics\
    \ (ST) data.\nIt aims to address the lack of a comprehensive evaluation framework\
    \ for spatial simulators\nand explore the feasibility of leveraging existing single-cell\
    \ simulators for ST data.\nThe experimental setup involves collecting public spatial\
    \ transcriptomics datasets and\ncorresponding scRNA-seq datasets.\nThe spatial\
    \ and scRNA-seq datasets can originate from different study but should consist\n\
    of similar cell types from similar tissues.\n"
