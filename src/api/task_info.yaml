motivation: |
  Computational methods for spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) are frequently developed 
  and assessed through data simulation. The effectiveness of these evaluations relies on the 
  simulation methodsâ€™ ability to accurately reflect experimental data. However, a systematic 
  evaluation framework for spatial simulators is lacking. Here, we present SpatialSimBench, 
  a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses 13 simulation methods using 10 distinct 
  STR datasets.
description: |
  Through SpatialSimBench, we demonstrate the feasibility of leveraging existing single-cell 
   simulators for SRT data and highlight performance differences among methods. Additionally, 
   we evaluate the simulation methods based on a total of 35 metrics across data property 
   estimation, various downstream analysis and scalability. In total, we generated 4550 results 
   from 13 simulation methods, 10 spatial datasets and 35 metrics.
